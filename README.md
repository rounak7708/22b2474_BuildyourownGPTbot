Build Your Own GPT Bot

SoC 2025 – Natural Language Processing Project
Student: Rounak Gupta · Roll No.: 22b2474 · Project UID: 143

Overview
This project is an end-to-end exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). It covers classical NLP techniques, deep learning with PyTorch, Transformers, prompt engineering, and the deployment of chatbots using APIs and local models. The goal was to build domain-specific and general-purpose GPT-like bots through structured weekly milestones.
